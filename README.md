# AraAssim-Vector-magnitude-and-arctangent-approximation

The objective of this project is to design a system for approximating magnitude and arctangent (phase) of vectors in Verilog HDL, the Verilog code, the testbench and all the required technology files are provided here with a description. Using the source codes, modeling at the behavioral level can done using Cadence Incisive tool, in addition to that, the system can be synthesized using Cadence RTL compiler tool so then its layout (using xh018 technology of X-FAB) can generated automatically using Cadence Encounter tool.

To create the layout of the digital IC for this project, it is necessary to go through the following three stages:

1. Creating the description of the device at the behavioral level (in Verilog HDL) and running the simulation to generate timing diagrams for the device, at this stage we may use Cadence Incisive, with the help of the top module verilog .v file (simulink_functio.v) and the testbench (simulink_functio_tb.v).

2. Performing logical synthesis of the device with reference to the technological library, at the end of this stage, we obtain the netlist of the device which consists of logic gates and interconnections.

3. Generating a layout from the list of logical gates and interconnects obtained at the synthesis stage.

In order to build this project, you need to:
1. Download the Source folder, it contains the files " simulink_functio.v", " simulink_functio.sdc", " simulink_functio_tb.v ", " simulink_functio_tb_final.v", " Module_pins ", " in_im.dat", "in_re.dat" , “alpha_arctangen_expected.dat”, “magnitude_expected.dat”.

2. Download the Scripts folder, the scripts listed here should be available "X-FAB_typ.tcl", "X-FAB_slow.tcl", "X-FAB_fast.tcl", " simulink_functio_synth.tcl", " simulink_functio_synth_20.tcl", " simulink_functio_synth_slow.tcl, " simulink_functio_synth_fast.tcl”, " MMMC.tcl "," Simulink_function_PaR ", in scripts" X-FAB_typ.tcl "," X-FAB_slow.tcl "," X-FAB_fast.tcl "," MMMC. tcl " , please pay attention to the paths to the technology library files in accordance with their location in your system.

3. (This stage is optional), you may create timing diagrams in Cadence Incisive or Xilinx for example using the Verilog code and its testbench but in this case, the device’s correct functionality has been verified so you may do it only if you want to.

4. Create a file to perform logic synthesis, in this coursework (Cadence RTL complier was used) and in the software run the script " simulink_functio_synth.tcl ".

5. To check timing and area reports for typical, slow and fast corners, it is required to create a folder to save the timing diagrams, then you may run the " simulink_functio_synth.tcl ", " simulink_functio_synth_slow.tcl, " simulink_functio_synth_fast.tcl” to see the reports for different corners.
